# NumPy Docs Extension Work Plan

1. Review the current repository structure, Raycast configuration (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, ESLint/Prettier), and the empty `src/numpy-docs.ts` to confirm baseline requirements and coding standards.
2. Design the NumPy search workflow using Read the Docs search APIs, decide on caching/debouncing strategies, and outline how to parse NumPy HTML for signatures, descriptions, parameters, and return values while staying aligned with Raycast extension interaction patterns.
3. Implement the Raycast command with official `@raycast/api` components (`List`, `Detail`, `ActionPanel`, `Action.OpenInBrowser`, etc.), handling loading, error, and empty states in accordance with Raycast UX guidance.
4. Create unit tests for parsing helpers and any non-UI logic (e.g., transforming API responses), integrating a lightweight framework such as Vitest to keep coverage maintainable.
5. Hook up data fetching, markdown generation, and browser-opening actions end-to-end, ensuring all code adheres to Raycast standards (TypeScript strictness, lint rules, Prettier formatting) and providing inline documentation where logic is non-obvious.
6. Verify the command manually via `npm run dev`, adjust based on observed UX, update documentation (README/AGENTS) as needed, and prepare the repository for PR submission (lint/build passes).
